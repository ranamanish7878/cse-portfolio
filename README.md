# Manish CSE â€” Static Site

This workspace contains a single-page static portfolio site (index.html) for Manish Kumar.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Pc\site
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the dev dependency `live-server` and start a local development server at http://127.0.0.1:3000 (or http://localhost:3000). The `index.html` file is served from the project root.

Notes
- The site uses Tailwind via CDN and Google Fonts. No build step required.
- Replace placeholder content in `index.html` as needed.
